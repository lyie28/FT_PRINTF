# FT_PRINTF
Recoding the printf function in C

In this project, I recoded printf which handles the following conversions: cspdiuxX% and the following flags: -0.*

-> To download the code, git clone the link to my project in your terminal

-> You can test this program by using 'make' to create a library with this printf function inside

-> In your main where you call ft_printf(), add #include "includes/ft_printf.h"

-> To compile you main including the ft_printf library: gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror main.c -L. -lftprintf -o printf

-> Then run ./printf to see the results
